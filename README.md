# 🧠 Memory Card Game

Memory Card Game is a fun and fast-paced browser game where players test their memory by matching pairs of hidden cards. You have limited time to find all the matching pairs — flip quickly and remember where cards are hidden before the clock runs out!

I chose this project because I enjoy simple brain-challenging games, and it was a great way to improve my JavaScript skills, especially with DOM manipulation, timers, and handling game state.
